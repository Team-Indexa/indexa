# Business Model

## Revenue Philosophy

Indexa operates on a principle of monetizing capabilities rather than user identities. The business model is built on four distinct revenue streams that align with privacy-first values while ensuring long-term sustainability.

**Value-Based Monetization**
- Developers pay for access to capabilities
- AI features available through subscription
- Advertising remains contextual only
- Revenue tied to utility, not surveillance
